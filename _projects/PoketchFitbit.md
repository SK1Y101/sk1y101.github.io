## Motivation

When I first started this project, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were mere weeks from releasing. I had always loved the Pokétch from the original games, and now that I had developed some watch faces of my own, I seriously considered bringing one into the real world.

## Links

While there are links to the project in the header of this page, I'll also add the links here!

#### Fitbit Store

As there are two versions of the Fitbit OS currently used, there are two store links too!
