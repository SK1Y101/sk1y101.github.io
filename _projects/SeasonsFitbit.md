## Project

I love the weather, looking at the MET office forecast is one of my favourite things to do.
But sometimes I feel a little lazy, or my phone is in a different room, and I still want to see what the forecast is like.

"Well, how about adding it to your wrist in an easy to use format with simple customization?"
Excellent idea, that's what this is!

A clock face that changes with the seasons, the local weather, and the time of day. To give you an accurate<sup>ish</sup> view of what's happening outside your home.
