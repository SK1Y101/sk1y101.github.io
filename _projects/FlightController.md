# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).
#toc:
#  - name:
    # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
    # subsections:

<!-- SSTO Steps

Launch:
> enable engines
> Engage brakes
> Throttle to maximum
> Disengage brakes when speed > 1 m/s

Flight:
> Maintain level flight until speed > 400 m/s
> Pitch up between 5 and 20 degrees, depending on lift and thrust of vehicle
> Maintain attitude
> Toggle Rapier to vacuum mode when velocity decreases
> Point prograde at some point (Maybe when apoapsis exceeds 55km?)
> Circularise at apoapsis

Landing:
> Reduce Periapsis to 50km at around 200 degrees ahead of ksc
> Maintain AoA of 5-25 degrees, depending on flight characteristics I haven't worked out yet
> Survive
> Fly back to KSC-->
