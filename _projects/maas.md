description: Metal As A Service
highlights:
    - MAAS transforms physical servers into agile, cloud-like resources. It simplifies the provisioning, monitoring, and management of bare metal servers, enabling remote and automated operations similar to handling virtual machines.
    - With MAAS, manual management of individual servers is eliminated. You can remotely deploy operating systems to bare metal servers, allowing quick setup, dismantling, and reconfiguration as needed.
