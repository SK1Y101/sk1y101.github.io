My [Masters thesis](https://lloydwaltersj.com/projects/TransitProject/) was a decent first pass at the problem, but constrained by time. I intend to improve upon that, fixing the knwon flaws and optimising the methods of that paper in the hopes of generating better data (and a better computational pipeline) than was possible last year.
