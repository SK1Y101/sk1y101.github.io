## Motivation

When I first started this project, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were mere weeks from releasing. I had always loved the Pokétch from the original games, and now that I had developed some watch faces of my own, I seriously considered bringing one into the real world.

# Fitbit Pokétch
A Fitbit clock-face in the style of the Pokémon Generation IV Pokétch.

## Pokétch.

### Features available

Unlike the original Pokétch, which came with 25 applications, my Pokétch watch face comes with just 7, which are, in order:

Digital clock        - Shows the time

Pedometer          - Shows your steps

Stats view           - Shows your other stats

Counter               - Manually count something with the press of a button

Analogue Watch  - Shows the time again!

Move Calc  - Shows how effective an attack will be

Calendar              - Want to know the current date?

Timer                   - Count down from up to 99 minutes. (Accuracy may vary)

Tap the bottom half of the screen to cycle through the applications, or tap the top half to cycle backwards.

To enable/disable certain applications, use the dropdown available in the settings for the watch face. By default, only the digital watch face is visible.

### Customisation

Button             - Diamond/Pearl single button, or the Platinum double button

Face colour     - Dark watch face, or the Light watch face

Edge colour     - Diamond blue, Pearl pink, Barry's orange, Platnium blue, or Platinum pink

Screen colour  - Default Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, Violet, Indigo, Blue, and Grey

Mascot         - Want an Eevee, or a Pikachu on your digital clock?

Wherever possible, I have tried to keep the watch feature and aesthetics as close to the original Pokétch from the games, with minimal changes.

For further description of watch features, see the wiki pages in the github repo [here](https://github.com/SK1Y101/PoketchFitbit/wiki)

## Links

While there are links to the project in the header of this page, I'll also add the links here!

#### Fitbit Store

As there are two versions of the Fitbit OS currently used, there are two store links too!
