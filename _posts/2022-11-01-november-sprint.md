# Location

We're off to the lovely city of Prague!

I'd never travelled across europe before this, so I used it as an opportunity to visit a few more places than stricly neccesary, and spend a few hours at different train stations.

I should apologise for the image quality: This was the final month of my dying old phone.

# Sumamry

Time: 44h 9m

Countries: 4 (UK, BE, DE, CZ)

Distance: 2803Km

Trains: Solid across the board. Was very surprised to find loco hauled services in Czechia, but it was a pleasant surprise.

Stations: Bruxelles was the lowest point of the journey, Köln was the highest. Regensburg was quite nice.

Destination: Loved Prague, favourite european city to have visited yet.

Planned time: 21h 55m

Standard trains where I live, electrostar 377, so I didn't take many photos. Only this image of the final train as I walked past it at London Victoria.

## St. Pancras
| Departure | Arrival | Location |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| 15.04 | 17.05 | Bruxelles Midi |

I really wish I'd grabbed a picture of all the Tube trains I jumped on, because the Victoria line was very delayed, but I was a little more focused on getting to St.Pancras on time!

Boarding the absolutely gorgeous Eurostar e320, I took a slightly blurry image of the other stabled beside us. They served a delicious meal too!

My first time in belgium. Bruxelles Midi was definitely a station. Thalys services were awesome, but someone was sat in my seat before I boarded ):

| 22.15 | 05.11 | Berlin Hauptbahnhof |

This might be my all time favourite station. I loved the hours sat here watching the trains go by while eating dinner. This was also my first experience with night running trains, which was quite the enjoyable time.

| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| 08.00 | 12.35 | Praha Holešovice |

Very enjoyable, wandered across all the levels and took a small walk outside waiting for the trainsfer. Both the train and backup train were canceled however, which was a little stressful when you're a million metres from home.

Relaxed at Prague with mapo tofu for lunch. I visited this place a few more times to sample the food, it was delicious

I was a bit too tired for a photo of the train at Regensburg, so instead have a photo of the carraige I slept in when we reached Köln.

It was a very novel and enjoyable experience riding a sleeper train, would absolutely do it again!
