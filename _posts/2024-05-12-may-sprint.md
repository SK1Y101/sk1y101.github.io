# Location

Madrid. I've not been there except for a flight transfer nearly 15 years beforehand, so it'll be interesting to arrive by the (obviously) superior mode of transport


# Sumamry

Time: 40h 20m

Countries: 3 (UK, FR, ES)

Distance: 4506Km, Cummulative 9613Km

Trains: Fastest ever train I've noticed, and super comfy. Full points to trenitalia. TGV InOui also gets full points for comfort and speed, would definitely reccomend them over other french high-speed rail operators!

Stations: Gare du Nord is a much nicer station, but the RER sucks. maybe a 7/10 overall, Atocha was delightful.

Destination: Madrid was okay, solidly mediocre city. Won't complain if I go back, but also won't choose it over other destinations;


# Outbound May 11, 2024

Planned time: 23h 7m

Transfers: 6

Countries: 3 (UK, FR, ES)

Distance: 2253Km

Most looked forward to train: Iryo Barcelona to Madrid

Fairly standard at this point, though being on one of the last trains is certainly new.
I don't actually remember what train I took from TBD to STP, I just jumped on a thameslink as it rolled in. I had been planning on a 2am connection, but luckily the other train was delayed enough to make it.

I did manage to get a great night shot at blackfriars though, so no complaints!

The earliest Eurostar service I've ever been on, makes a change to get the breakfast meal!
The pastry was delicious, but I do wish they'd served just a little more...

## Gare de Lyon

It was a bit of a rush (common theme this journey), and my first time on the RER. It was an... experience. The Ougio service I was on was very comfortable, and another double decker train is always great! good view leaving Gare de Lyon too.

With the previous train running late, this was easily my closest ever transfer, just five minutes to run down into the subway, across four platforms, and back up again to meet my onward connection. Probably should've added a little more than 10 minutes into my transfer planning, but the later connections to madrid didn't quite allow it.

Had to take the train pics at Barcelona (for obvious reasons). I loved the views from the cafe car as we passed along the mediteranean. Easily my favourite part of the entire journey.

This journey was amazing! The food was delicious and I *think* this might have set a new personal high speed record at 320km/h (not that I got a photo of it, what do you think I am, a professional)

Madrid has a bare but decent departures area, you can see all of the trains coming and going (Not that there were many this early in the morning!)

We were held at Avignon TGV for almost 85 minutes, which *absolutely* did not cause quite a chunk of anxiety. though we made up for lost time.
Additionally, the RER further cemented itself as my least favourite way of crossing any city ever devised. Next time I make this transfer, I think I'd rather build in the time to walk.

What can I say, another excellent Eurostar trip with good food. Favourite rail operator, but they could definitely do with some competition to lower those prices.

Regular trains, no pictures, but I did snap a shot of the Shard
