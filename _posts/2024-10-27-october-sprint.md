# Location

Den Haag, or the Hague, was definitely a place I've had my eye on for a few years now. And not just so I can see all of the NS trains moving around (although that would definitely be amazing).
Unfortunately, despite this being the easiest rail journey by far, I couldn't quite convince any other UK colleagues to join me on Eurostar. We did, however, have the highest representation of rail-travel in the team of any previous sprint, so that's a win!


# Sumamry

Time: 17h 55m

Countries: 3 (UK, BE, NL)

Distance: 790Km, Cummulative 10403Km

Trains: Eurostar and a heritage steam locomotive?! How could this be anything but 10/10.

Stations: Rotterdaam Central was awesome, as was Den Haag. Definitely wish they were my local

Destination: I **loved** the Hague. A city of trams, pedestrian priority, and delightful architecture. 9/10, would move there except for the smell of drug usage.

I actually remembered to take a picture of one of the trains, despite them being normal and boring!

We love eurostar, so so so much here, and despite being seated in *shudder* standard class, this was still no exception. The further journey out to the Netherlands was great, definitely enjoyed the scenery along the route.
Rotterdam Centraal has definitely been my favourite Eurostar station. Now I just need to try out Lille and Amsterdam Centraal!

## Rotterdam Centraal

| Departure | Arrival | Location |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------- |
| 16:18 | 16:21 | Den Haag Centraal |

I didn't take any pictures, and I'm not even completely sure this was my departure/arrival time. It is, howver, what's listed in my rail travel calendar, so I'll believe it.

Side note: Den Haag is so multimodal, and a really clean and open station. Definitely a great place to pass through imo.


# Inbound November 02, 2024

Planned time: 9h 23m

Transfers: 4

Countries: (NL, BE, UK)

Distance: 395Km

Most looked forward to train: Eurostar to St. Pancras

## Den Haag Centraal

| Departure | Arrival | Location |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------- |
| 06:36 | 06:49 | Rotterdam Centraal |

Yet another case of not being sure on the timings, but the metadata on my images at Den Haag and Rotterdam say these times, and that would never be wrong, right? /s

Anyway, Loved the station and the Metro line. Was a lot nicer early in the morning with very few passengers.

It took me completely by surprise that eurostar are considered regular high speed trains between european cities, but I guess it makes compllete sense for anywhere part of Schengen. Wasn't a fan of the other passengers, and definitely not the noise level of the families, but what are you going to do when you're saddled in standard?

There was a short period where I didn't expect to be able to take this, due to the engineering works on HSL-1 north of Lille. Fortunately, It was a possible journey, and no train nerds were harmed in the making of these images.

Relatively standard journey home afterwards, and while this train isn't the one I rode on, it is representative.
