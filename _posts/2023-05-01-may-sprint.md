Here we go, my first time back to Gare du Nord in about a decade. Eurostar premiere is always worth it, the food was delicious

I've never been on a double decker train before, nor on the TGV in general, so I was quite impressed. Absolutely loved this train.

This is also the fastest train I've ever been on, beating the previous ICE record for me. I'm hoping to sample more 300km/h trains in future!

What can I say, I loved the sleeper last time, so I'll f*cking do it again. I don't think I've ever had such a good wake up, as on a train slowly drifting through a beautiful valley

Oh look, he's on a night train again. What a surprise.

But seriously, this may be the best non-high-speed way to sample european trains

Lovely overhead view of the terminus as my train home disembarks passengers. This is an excellent place to sit while waiting for the train. Eurostar food is awesome, as per usual.

Yet another example of trains I didn't think were important enough for a photo.
