# Location

Göteborg
I've always wondered what Sweden was like, and a stop in Denmark sounds lovely too!

# Summary

Time: 57h 4m

Countries: 5 (GB, BE, DE, DK, SE)

Distance: 4810Km, Cummulative 17453Km

Trains: Well, I accidentally saw more than intended, and more trains *is* more good, so.. 8/10, the Hamburg to Köln train had some awful passengers that's really pulling this down.

Stations: I *absolutely* loved the vibes at København and Hamburg. If they weren't so far away, I would love to revisit! My side quest to the west coast of Denmark was actually lovely, time pressure aside, maybe I should visit again?

Destination: Göteborg was nice, not especially cold compared to my expectations. I loved all of the trams there, very excellent public transport network.


# Outbound November 1, 2025

Planned time: 30h 7m

Transfers: 8

Countries: 5 (GB, BE, DE, DK, SE)

Distance: 2305Km

Most looked forward to train: SJR to Göteborg

I had a lovely, if cold, time here. Watching the trains from the platforms was great, even if after 4 hours I was bored and ready to leave.

I absolutely loved this statio, the architecture, the view from where I grabbed breakfasts! I just wish the platforms were a little wider, it was quite cramped waiting for my denmark train.
Also I wish I got more pictures of the route, it was incredibly scenic.

Fans of JetLag: The Game will recognise the model and location I just *had* to visit while I was there. The trains were fun too, if a little weird. I haven't seen the all metal body that SJR seems to employ... well, ever!

I admit, I was actually quite stressed here, given it was a replacement bus service to København. Especially when I couldn't find the stand for the first bus, and then watched the second one leave as I arrived, and then couldn't get on the third due to overcrowding...

I'm sorry for compressing so many transfers into one spot, but this was meant to be a simple two train trip to Köln, not a veritable side quest that *only* just got me to my Hamburg onwards train.
Long story short, I missed the first train to Odense, which meant I couldn't connect to my onward one. Danish rail staff at København, you were amazing. You dealt with a very stressed and very close to tears girls issue with minimal fuss, and incredibly clear instructions.
And no, I was not really in the right mindset for pictures, how can you tell?

Back on track (heh) finally, and this was a very quiet train journey. Just two other people in my carriage! lovely! I love ICE trains that really aren't that busy, they're so lovely.

I will say though, after this I think I'll try to avoid long stays at Köln. For as much as I like the station, the 4h30m ish that I was there was *very* tedious, especially after such a high stress trip to here.

Eurostar, my comfy, my beloved. I was *so* glad to be back in the first class experience on a trip back to my home country, especially given how quiet it was and how nice the food was.

Early morning trains are awesome, first to Bruxelles, now this? Heck yeah!

Hey look, I made the train I never think I can get!
I tell you, thameslink has never been so comfy as it was this journey

Also I had an impeccable croissant at east croydon, tripple chocolate! absolutely delightful.
