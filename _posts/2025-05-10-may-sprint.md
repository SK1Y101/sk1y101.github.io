# Location

Frankfurt
I was kind of excited to revisit germany, and especially pass through cologne, my favourite european train station!

# Outbound May 10, 2025

Planned time: 10h 7m planned, 11h 18m actual

Transfers: 3 planned, 4 actual

Countries: 3 (UK, BE, DE)

Distance: 920Km

Most looked forward to train: ICE to Frankfurt

## Havant
Departure – 11:16><br>Arrival Three bridges – 12:43
Departure – 12:50><br>Arrival St. Pancras – 13:40

Pretty standard travel, but the weather was nice. I actually remembered to take a photo of all of the trains for once!

## St. Pancras
Departure – 15:04<br>Arrival Bruxelles Midi – 18:05

Saw le shuttle out of the window, and enjoyed some delivious food. I'm always so tempted to steal the etched glasses, but I refrained this time. Eurostar is always a 10/10.

## Bruxelles Midi
Departure – 18:54><br>Arrival Liège-Guillemins – 20:04

Well, I was never meant to be on this train, but my Bruxelles->Frankfurt connection was cancelled due to a stuck coupling system (apparently) so we get an extra (terrible) rail connection out to Liège to meet my original train.
I think my opinion of SNCB would be improved if I had intended to be on this trian, rather than it being a packed replacement.

## Liège-Guillemins
Departure – 20:10<br>Arrival Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof – 23:36

Finaly on the correct train, and had a lovely time of this ICE 3 unit. we absolutely love high speed trains in germany... when you don't get the Deutsch-Bahn'ed.
The frankfurt HAuptbahnhof picture was taken a day later, I include it just to show off the great architecture

# Inbound May 17, 2025

Planned time: 9h 40m

Transfers: 3

Countries: 3 (DE, BE, UK)

Distance: 920Km

Most looked forward to train: Eurostar to St. Pancras

## Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof
Departure – 09:49<br>Arrival Bruxelles Midi – 13:35

The single connection I was originally meant to take. An otherwise perfectly fine journey elevated by the other passengers very politely telling off a rowdy drunk crowd. To the five german passengers who made the first leg to cologne a blast, 11/10.

## Bruxelles Midi
Departure – 14:52<br>Arrival St. Pancras – 15:57

We love eurostar. We love eurostar.
Also got a lovely view of the tunnel portal with the 30 year anniversary decal as we entered, and a lovely meal. 10/10 as always.

## St. Pancras
Departure – 16:20><br>Arrival East Croydon – 17:06
Departure – 17:14><br>Arrival Havant – 18:29

Standard train journey, I always think I'll miss this onnection and have to wait 30 minutes. I am always wrong about this.

# Rating

Trains: We love DB rolling stock, we dislike DB timetabling.solid set of trains though, 8/10.

Stations: Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof was surprisingly nice, and Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof has some lovely architecture.

Destination: Frankfurt around the hauptbahnhof was easily one of the worst locations I have ever been to. The old town and parts of the river were nicer, I would definitely reccomend you take the U-Bahn or S-Bahn from the station, rather than going on foot.
