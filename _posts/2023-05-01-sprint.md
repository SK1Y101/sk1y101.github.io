A standard southern then thameslink connection. Didn't think it was worth the photo opportunity, but got a nice look at the london skyline

## St. Pancras
Departure – 12:31<br>Arrival Gare du Nord – 15:47

Here we go, my first time back to Gare du Nord in about a decade. Eurostar premiere is always worth it, the food was delicious

## Gare de Paris-Est
Departure – 19:07<br>Arrival Mannheim Hauptbahnhof – 22:17

I've never been on a double decker train before, nor on the TGV in general, so I was quite impressed. Absolutely loved this train.

This is also the fastest train I've ever been on, beating the previous ICE record for me. I'm hoping to sample more 300km/h trains in future!

## Mannheim Hauptbahnhof
Departure – 23:42<br>Arrival Praha hlavní nádraží – 09:38

What can I say, I loved the sleeper last time, so I'l f*cking do it again. I don't think I've ever had such a good wake up, as on a train slowly drifting through a beautiful valley

Most looked forward to train: Offenburg Bahnhof to Gare de Paris-Est

## Praha hlavní nádraží
Departure – 18:26<br>Arrival Offenburg Bahnhof – 05:45

Oh look, he's on a night train again. What a surprise.

But seriously, this may be the best non-high-speed way to sample european trains

## Offenburg Bahnhof

Picture was taken at the destination, but damn if that isn't a good looking train

## Gare du Nord
Departure – 13:13<br>Arrival St. Pancras – 14:30

Lovely overhead view of the terminus as my train home disembarks passengers. This is an excellent place to sit while waiting for the train. Eurostar food is awesome, as per usual.

Yet another example of trains I didn't think were important enough for a photo.

# Rating

Trains: An excellent set, probably the best in a journey so far

Stations: I'm so glad I went via Paris this time. The stations are so much nicer (sorry Belgium!)

Destination: We love Prague
