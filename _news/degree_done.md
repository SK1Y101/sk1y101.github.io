That's it, The culmination of my entire degree has been completed. 210 hours of code, 152 commits, 97498 additions, 36845 deletions, 5000 exoplanets, 4000 transits, and four models to describe them all. It's been an amazing journey, and I'm proud to leave this as my Masters legacy.

Everything is accessible in the masters project section, and the attached GitHub repo.
