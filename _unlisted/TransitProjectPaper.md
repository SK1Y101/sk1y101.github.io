## Abstract

Transit Timing Variation (TTV) provides a powerful tool to probe the dynamical configuration of exoplanetary systems from historical transit data <d-cite key="firstTTVPaper"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="secondTTVPaper"></d-cite>. TTV analysis has allowed both verification of planetary parameters <d-cite key="TrappistMass"></d-cite> and the discovery of new planetary bodies <d-cite key="Keplerc"></d-cite> from transit observation alone.
As part of this work, additional transit light curves have been collected with the 24" Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope at Clanfield observatory and combined with the ExoClock database <d-cite key="ExoClockI"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="ExoClockII"></d-cite>, Exoplanet transit database <d-cite key="ETD"></d-cite>, and *TESS* light curves <d-cite key="tess"></d-cite> to create a set of historical TTV data for analysis.
A set of extensible TTV models have been developed to analytically approximate the chaotic n-body nature of real planetary systems. A computational pipeline to automate model fitting using various parameter optimisation <d-cite key="diffEvo"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="dualAnnealing"></d-cite> and model comparison <d-cite key="AIC"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="AIC2"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="AICC"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="BIC"></d-cite> techniques has been developed in-situ, allowing verification of model validity and analysis of TTV candidates using a combination of simulation and historical TTV data.
The models developed were found to accurately describe TTV, and could determine the initial system parameters of simulated TTV systems to reasonable accuracy.
Future work will allow extensions to these models, providing a more powerful suite of analytical tools for exoplanetary science, and the application of these methods to real exoplanetary systems with the possibility of new planetary discoveries.
