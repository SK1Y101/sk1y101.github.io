# Abstract
Transit Timing Variation (TTV) provides a powerful tool to probe the dynamical configuration of exoplanetary systems from historical transit data <d-cite key="firstTTVPaper"></d-cite>;<d-cite key="secondTTVPaper"></d-cite>. TTV analysis has allowed both verification of planetary parameters <d-cite key="TrappistMass"></d-cite> and the discovery of new planetary bodies <d-cite key="Keplerc"></d-cite> from transit observation alone.
As part of this work, additional transit light curves have been collected with the 24" Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope at Clanfield observatory and combined with the ExoClock database <d-cite key="ExoClockI"></d-cite>;<d-cite key="ExoClockII"></d-cite>, Exoplanet transit database <d-cite key="ETD"></d-cite>, and *TESS* light curves <d-cite key="tess"></d-cite> to create a set of historical TTV data for analysis.
A set of extensible TTV models have been developed to analytically approximate the chaotic n-body nature of real planetary systems. A computational pipeline to automate model fitting using various parameter optimisation <d-cite key="diffEvo"></d-cite>;<d-cite key="dualAnnealing"></d-cite> and model comparison <d-cite key="AIC"></d-cite>;<d-cite key="AIC2"></d-cite>;<d-cite key="AICC"></d-cite>;<d-cite key="BIC"></d-cite> techniques has been developed in-situ, allowing verification of model validity and analysis of TTV candidates using a combination of simulation and historical TTV data.
The models developed were found to accurately describe TTV, and could determine the initial system parameters of simulated TTV systems to reasonable accuracy.
Future work will allow extensions to these models, providing a more powerful suite of analytical tools for exoplanetary science, and the application of these methods to real exoplanetary systems with the possibility of new planetary discoveries.

# Introduction

In the last quarter-century, exoplanet detections have seen astronomical success, in no small part due to the launch of several space bourne telescopes. Of the 5000 planets found within 3800 planetary systems, around three quarters have been discovered through transit photometry <d-cite key="exoplanetArchive"></d-cite>. To this day, over 130 million light curves have been observed, providing a large base for historical analysis.

Of particular interest for this project is a specific subset of transit photometry that makes heavy use of this historical data. ``Transit Timing Variation'', or ``TTV'', reanalyses historical transit observations for deviation from 2-body Keplerian motion to provide an insight into the dynamics of an exoplanetary system.

## Transit photometry

In the case that an exoplanetary system is oriented `edge on` from our vantage point on earth, then planets within the system will periodically occlude the central star. By observing the occlusion, it is possible to determine many of the physical and orbital parameters of an exoplanet.

{% capture occdepth %}{% increment equation_num %}{% endcapture %}
$$
    \Delta_L = \frac{\theta_{planet}}{\theta_{star}} = \frac{R_{planet}^2}{R_{star}^2} \approx \frac{r_{planet}^2}{r_{star}^2} \text{\color{aqua}[ {{ complexmod }} ]}
$$

The reduction in stellar light observed during each transit, ``Occlusion depth'', is proportional to the angular areas of both the planet and star. An expression for this is given in equation <fig>[ {{ occdepth }} ]</fig>, where $$\theta$$ is the angular area, and $$R$$ the angular radius of each object. In the small angle approximation, the ratio of $$R$$ becomes equal to the ratio of $$r$$, the true radii of each object.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Images/TransitLocation}
    \caption[Exoplanet location to observed light curve]{How the location of an exoplanet corresponds to the observed light curve. Stellar limb darkening was ignored for simplicity.}
    \label{fig:transitLoc}
\end{figure}

Under the approximation that an exoplanetary transit is small compared to the size of its orbit, the velocity of the exoplanet, $$v_{planet}$$, will remain constant. By approximating the transit as a line segment, the time duration of this transit will be proportional to the combined diameters of the body and star, as demonstrated by figure \ref{fig:transitLoc}, and expressed in equation \ref{eq:transitduration}.

$$
    T_{transit} = \frac{2 \left(R_{star} + R_{planet}\right)}{v_{planet}}
    \label{eq:transitduration}
$$

By instead considering the transit as a circular arc (and assuming the orbital eccentricity is low), the expression for transit duration is given in equation \ref{eq:transitduration2}, where $$a$$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit.

$$
    T_{transit} = \frac{2a}{v_{planet}}\arcsin\frac{R_{star}+R_{planet}}{a}
    \label{eq:transitduration2}
$$

Introducing the effect of orbital inclination further complicates this approximation, as the exoplanet will not transit across the equator of the stellar disc, as demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:inclinedtransit}. This introduces the quantity known as the ``Impact parameter'', and is given in equation \ref{eq:impact}, where $$i$$ is the orbital inclination and $$\Omega$$ the longitude of the ascending node.

$$
    b = a \cos{i}\sin{\Omega}
    \label{eq:impact}
$$

$$
    T_{transit} = \frac{2a}{v_{planet}}\arcsin\frac{\sqrt{ \left(R_{star}+R_{planet}\right)^2 - b^2 }}{a}
    \label{eq:transitduration3}
$$

Introducing the impact parameter, $$b$$, to equation \ref{eq:transitduration2} gives the expression given in equation \ref{eq:transitduration3}. This allows information about both the inclination and radius of the orbit to be deduced from a single transit. A full derivation of equations \ref{eq:transitduration}, \ref{eq:transitduration2}, and \ref{eq:transitduration3} is given in section \ref{transitderiv}.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Images/inclinedOrbit}
    \caption[Exoplanet inclination to transit length]{How the orbital inclination affects the length of a transit. The axis scale is in stellar radii, and it can be seen in this configuration that a transit would only be visible if the relative inclination were in the region of $$\pm 1$$ degree.}
    \label{fig:inclinedtransit}
\end{figure}

## Transit timing}

TTV, by definition, is any departure from the predicted transit timing for an exoplanet as given by its linear ephemerides. While this can be due to a multitude of reasons, of primary interest for this paper are those transit timing variations caused by additional planets in the system <d-cite key="firstTTVPaper,secondTTVPaper}.

In the case where a system contains only a central star and orbiting planet, the equations of motion for the system are given by the closed-form Keplerian equations. Introducing an additional body to the system, however, causes the equations of motion to become chaotic, with no closed-form solution possible. This departure from Keplerian motion due to an additional gravitating body results in any transiting planets exhibiting TTV, whose parameters are related in some way to the orbital and physical properties of the perturbing body.

In the case where gravitational interactions between orbiting bodies are small compared to the gravity of the central star, the motion of each body can be described as some small perturbation atop the closed-form Keplerian equations. Measuring TTV allows the dynamical configuration of the system to be probed, as these are entirely caused by gravitational perturbation. This was demonstrated for the TRAPPIST-1 system, where the masses and orbital configurations of the planets were deduced from transit timing variations <d-cite key="TrappistMass}, and for the Kepler-19 system, where an additional planet was discovered through TTV analysis <d-cite key="Keplerc}, to name but two examples.

Of particular interest for this project are the three following causes for transit timing variations: Barycentre motion; Orbital perturbation; and mean motion libration. While other causes are evident, these are a useful starting ground for intuition.

### Barycentre motion}\label{section:barycentre}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Images/TTVDueToInnerBarycentre}
    \caption[TTV due to interior perturbation]{Transit timing variations due to interior planetary motion shifting the barycentre. From left to right are the early-time, expected time, and late-time transits. Note how, as the graphics are co-rotating with the transiting planet-barycentre reference frame, it is the apparent motion of the star that causes TTV.}
    \label{fig:interiorTTV}
\end{figure}

As all bodies in an exoplanetary system orbit about the common barycentre, rather than the centre of the parent star, the position of the star will appear to shift over time. This motion underpins both Doppler spectroscopic and astrometric methods for exoplanetary detection, and also results in variations in transit times.

As a transit occurs when the star and planet are aligned, the motion of the star relative to the barycentre will affect the timing of a transit. As the star moves, the planet must also move along its orbit for a transit to occur. The difference in position of the exoplanet as compared to if the star had not moved causes transits to occur earlier or later than predicted. This variation is a function of the position of the barycentre, as shown in figure \ref{fig:interiorTTV}, and is especially sensitive to massive planets that orbit interior to the transiting planet.

### Orbital perturbation}\label{section:perturbation}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Images/TTVDueToPerturbation}
    \caption[TTV due to exterior perturbation]{Transit timing variations due to exterior planet(s) perturbing the orbit of the transiting planet. The solid line is the unperturbed orbit, the dashed is the instantaneous perturbed orbit, and the arrow marks the instantaneous perturbing force vector. From left to right are the early-time, expected time, and late-time transits.}
    \label{fig:exteriorTTV}
\end{figure}

As discussed, the equations of motion have no closed-form solution for systems with three or more bodies, but can be expressible as a set of perturbed 2-body solutions, as seen in figure \ref{fig:exteriorTTV}.

As perturbing planets orbit about the system, their gravitational interactions pull the transiting planet further ahead or behind its unperturbed position. This primarily affects the semi-major axis of the transiting planet, and thus it's period, causing the transit to appear earlier or later as the planet is in a lower or higher orbit than predicted from simple Keplerian motion. This motion is especially sensitive to massive perturbing planets exterior to the transiting planet on elliptical orbits.

### mean motion libration}

In the case where perturbing planets are in or near mean motion resonance with the transiting planet, the effects of orbital perturbation will be greatly exaggerated. As the planets are in mean motion resonance, where their orbital periods are expressed as some small integer ratio, they will only experience conjunctions at discrete locations along their orbits. This causes orbital perturbations to accumulate, rather than average out over many orbits.

As the planets orbit about the system, perturbation causes their respective periods to drift, as seen in figure \ref{fig:exteriorTTV}. This in turn causes the conjunction positions to drift along the orbit, causing the perturbations to act opposite once the conjunction locations have rotated $$180^{\circ}$$ relative to the initial position. This causes cyclic changes in orbital elements with larger magnitudes over longer timescales than any of the previously mentioned causes. These changes are especially sensitive to perturbing planets of much lower mass than seen in other TTV causes, particularly planets in first order resonance with the transiting planet, such as is seen in the kepler-19 system <d-cite key="Keplerc}.

## Project objectives}\label{objectives}

As the detection and analysis of transit timing variations rely on historical data, additional observations have been made throughout this project with the 24" Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope at Clanfield observatory. These observations were analysed with Holomon Photometric Software
 (HOPS) <d-cite key="HOPS}, and uploaded to the ExoClock database, where other transit observations are combined and verified <d-cite key="ExoClockI, ExoClockII}.

Transit data from both ExoClock and the exoplanet transit database (ETD) <d-cite key="ETD} have been combined with light curves from the *TESS* spacecraft <d-cite key="tess}. These light curves have been analysed with the Juliet python package to obtain mid-transit times <d-cite key="juliet}. A set of linear ephemerides were fit with linear regression to the observed transit data and compared with those published in both the ExoClock database and the NASA Exoplanet Archive <d-cite key="exoplanetArchive}. Computing predicted transit times from these linear ephemerides have allowed a set of TTV to be computed for each planetary target.

A set of analytical TTV Models have been developed to fit to this TTV data, providing a method for determining the configuration of each exoplanetary system from transit observation. These models have had parameters determined through various minimisation techniques using the SciPy package <d-cite key="scipy}, such as least squares regression <d-cite key="leastSquare}, bounded limited memory Broyden‚ÄìFletcher‚ÄìGoldfarb‚ÄìShanno <d-cite key="ByrdALM, ZhuAlgorithmL}, differential evolution <d-cite key="diffEvo}, and dual annealing <d-cite key="dualAnnealing}. The parameter distribution was determined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using the emcee package <d-cite key="emcee}. This was used to provide uncertainty bounds on reported values by taking the \nth{16}, \nth{50}, and \nth{84} quantiles of the MCMC samples.

# Methodology}

## TTV Models}\label{ttvmodels}

As a first step in transit timing variation analysis, a model, or set of models, is required against which data can be fitted. As these models will be used for any given simulation or real-world system setup, they must have the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Computationally inexpensive, models will need to be executed thousands of times for parameter fitting and should be vectorisable to take advantage of optimisation.
    \item Extensible, TTV models should be formulated with standard equations of motion, such that they can be further re-written to take advantage of more complex processes.
    \item System independent, many TTV models in the literature <d-cite key="secondTTVPaper, agol2016, agol2018} are presented in only the three body case. These models should be provided in a form that allows arbitrarily many planets to be accounted for.
\end{itemize}

Strictly speaking, there are three categories into which TTV models can be subdivided. Those are a transiting planet exterior to perturbing planets, a transiting planet interior to perturbing planets, and a transiting planet both interior and exterior to perturbing planets. These three model classes, demonstrated visually in figure \ref{fig:TTVClasses}, represent an increasing level of complexity for derivation. Of those, only the interior and exterior perturbations require derivation, as the boundary model is formed from a combination of the two.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Images/TTVModelSpace}
    \caption[Three classes of TTV]{Three classes of TTV cause, from left to right, are interior perturbation, exterior perturbation, and combined (or boundary) perturbation. The classes each represent a subtly different way of describing TTV, and the form of each model reflects the different approximations and approaches made.}
    \label{fig:TTVClasses}
\end{figure}

### Interior perturbation}\label{classone}

In the case where a transiting exoplanet orbits exterior to the perturbing planets, the transit timing variations seen will be dominated by the motion of the barycentre, as mentioned in section \ref{section:barycentre}. This setup is the most intuitive to understand, and makes a useful starting point.

#### Initial derivation}

The distance between the barycentre and primary body is given in equation \ref{eq:barycentre}, where $$r$$ is the distance between the primary and secondary, $$m_0$$ and $$m_1$$ are the masses of the primary and secondary respectively, and $$\mu$$ is the reduced mass of the secondary.

$$
    r_b = r \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_0} = r \mu_1
    \label{eq:barycentre}
$$

If we take the assumption that gravitational influences are dominated by that of the central star, any effects between planets will be negligible. Thus, the position of the global barycentre can be described as a linear combination of each planet in the system, as given in equation \ref{eq:multibarycentre}.

$$
    r_b = \sum_i^n  r_i \mu_i
    \label{eq:multibarycentre}
$$

The position of an exoplanet along its orbit is given in equation \ref{eq:orbitpos}, where $$P_i$$ is the orbital period of the planet, $$t_{0, i}$$ is the initial transit time of the planet, and $$\phi$$ is the angle between the planet, and the closest point of its orbit as seen from earth.

$$
    \phi = \frac{2 \pi \left(t - t_{0,i} \right)}{P_i}
    \label{eq:orbitpos}
$$

This expression of the angle of exoplanet position is equivalent to the mean anomaly of the planet, and can be combined with equation \ref{eq:multibarycentre} to obtain an expression for the position of the barycentre of the system at any given time, $$t$$, as given in equation \ref{eq:projbarycentre}. The introduction of the sine term is due to the nature of TTV. Only the motion of the barycentre perpendicular to the vantage point of the earth is relevant.

$$
    r_b = \sum_i^n \left[ r_i \mu_i \sin \frac{2 \pi \left(t - t_{0,i} \right)}{P_i}\right]
    \label{eq:projbarycentre}
$$

As this is the distance of the barycentre from the star, we can negate the expression to obtain the distance of the star from the barycentre. This also defines the additional distance the transiting planet must cover for the transit to occur.

$$
    \delta_x = -\sum_i^n \left[ r_i \mu_i \sin \frac{2 \pi \left(t - t_{0,i} \right)}{P_i}\right]
    \label{eq:ttvdist}
$$

If we assume the distance associated with a transit is small compared to the size of the orbit of the transiting planet, the velocity of all bodies in the system will remain constant during the transit. Thus, to convert the distance, $$\delta_x$$, to a transit timing variation, we can apply standard equations of motion, as given in equation \ref{eq:suvat}. As the stellar mass will be many orders of magnitude larger than the planet, it's velocity contribution to the TTV will be negligible.

$$
    t = \frac{\delta_x}{v_{planet} - v_{star}} \approx \frac{\delta_x}{v_{planet}}
    \label{eq:suvat}
$$

$$
    \label{eq:circorbitvel}
    v_{planet} = \sqrt{\frac{G\left(m_{star} + m_{planet}\right)}{a_{planet}}} = \frac{2 \pi a}{P_{planet}}
$$

If we assume the orbit of the transiting planet to be circular, the orbital velocity is that given in equation \ref{eq:circorbitvel}. This can be combined with equation \ref{eq:suvat} and equation \ref{eq:ttvdist} to provide an expression for the transit timing variation in this case, as given in equation \ref{eq:ttvbarycentre}.

$$
    \delta_T = -\frac{P_T}{2 \pi a_T}\sum_i^n \left[ a_i \mu_i \sin \frac{2 \pi \left(t - t_{0,i} \right)}{P_i}\right]
    \label{eq:ttvbarycentre}
$$

#### Extension to eccentric orbits}

While many of the approximations and assumptions made in the derivation of equation \ref{eq:ttvbarycentre} are valid for real planetary systems, the exclusion of orbital eccentricity will cause measurable deviation.

As the orbits are no longer circular, we cannot use $$a$$ and $$r$$ interchangeably, instead, we must use the planets' true anomaly, $$f$$, and eccentricity, $$e$$, as given in equation \ref{eq:orbitalradius}. Additionally, as orbital velocity varies over an elliptical orbit, we need to use the vis-viva equation as given in equation \ref{eq:visviva}.

$$
    \label{eq:orbitalradius}
    r = \frac{a \left(1 - e^2\right)}{1 + e \cos f}
$$

$$
    \label{eq:visviva}
    v = \sqrt{G\left(m_{star} + m_{planet}\right) \left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)}
$$

Introducing equation \ref{eq:orbitalradius} to equation \ref{eq:ttvbarycentre} gives the following expression for TTV, given in equation \ref{eq:partialeccentricity}. As the orbital distance equation requires introduction of the true anomaly, the term, $$\sin\frac{2\pi\left(t-t_{0,i}\right)}{P_i}$$, has also been replaced with the equivalent but more accurate expression using true anomaly and argument of periapsis, $$\sin\left(f_i + \omega_i\right)$.

$$
    \label{eq:partialeccentricity}
    \delta_T = -\frac{P_T}{2 \pi a_T}\sum_i^n \left[ a_i \mu_i \frac{1 - e_i^2}{1 + e_i \cos f_i} \sin \left(f_i + \omega_i\right) \right]
$$

Combining the vis-viva equation with the equation for orbital period, $$P = 2\pi\sqrt{a^3 / G\left(m_{star} + m_{planet}\right)}$$, gives equation \ref{eq:velocitynoG}, where the gravitational constant, $$G$$, is abstracted away.

$$
    \label{eq:velocitynoG}
    v = \frac{2\pi a}{P}\sqrt{\left(\frac{2a - r}{r}\right)}
$$

Introducing equation \ref{eq:orbitalradius} to equation \ref{eq:velocitynoG} gives equation \ref{eq:velocitynoR}, an expression for orbital velocity that does not require knowledge of distance from the star.

$$
    \label{eq:velocitynoR}
    v = \frac{2\pi a}{P}\sqrt{\frac{1 + 2 e \cos f + e^2}{1 - e^2}}
$$

This can be further combined with equation \ref{eq:partialeccentricity}, replacing our circular orbital velocity with the new eccentric orbital velocity, to give equation \ref{eq:TTVeccentric}, which is our model for TTV extended to include orbital eccentricity.

$$
    \label{eq:TTVeccentric}
    \begin{split}
        \delta_T &= -\frac{P_T}{2 \pi a_T}\left(\frac{1 - e_T^2}{1 + 2 e_T \cos f_T + e_T^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}\\
        & \cdot\sum_i^n \left[ a_i \mu_i \frac{1 - e_i^2}{1 + e_i \cos f_i} \sin \left(f_i + \omega_i\right) \right]
    \end{split}
$$

### Exterior perturbation}

To derive the effects of orbital perturbation, we follow a derivation for a two-planet case <d-cite key="agol2018}, and extend this to $$n$$ planets. We assume the transiting planet to have zero eccentricity and all planets are on coplanar orbits. We give the equation of motion for a body acting under gravity in equation \ref{eq:gravity}.

<!--$$
    \ddot{\mathbf{R}} = \sum_{j \ne i} \left[G m_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_i}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_i|}^3}\right]
    \label{eq:gravity}
$$-->

Where the bold indicates that the position of the planet, $$\mathbf{R}$$, is a vector. This can trivially be shown to satisfy \ref{eq:barycentrefixed}

$$
    \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{\ddot{R}}_i = 0
    \label{eq:barycentrefixed}
$$

Which is a demonstration that the centre of mass of the system, $$\mathbf{R}_{C.o.M}$$ is fixed, and no external forces are at play. This set of equations are most commonly used in numerical approaches; for an analytical approach to perturbation, it is more convenient to deal with the Jacobi coordinates of the system <d-cite key="3bodypulsar, murraybook}.

This gives a set of new coordinates, $$r_i$$, describing the position of the $$i^{th}$$ body relative to the mass interior to its orbit, as given in equation \ref{eq:jacobi}.

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbf{r}_0 &= \mathbf{R}_{C.o.M} = 0 \\
        \mathbf{r}_1 &= \mathbf{R}_1 - \frac{m_0\mathbf{R}_0}{m_0} = \mathbf{R}_1 - \mathbf{R}_0 \\
        \mathbf{r}_2 &= \mathbf{R}_2 - \frac{m_0\mathbf{R}_0+m_1\mathbf{R}_1}{m_0+m_1} \\
        &\shortvdotswithin{=} \\[-2em]
        \mathbf{r}_{n+1} &= \mathbf{R}_{n+1} - \frac{\sum^n_{j=0}m_j\mathbf{R}_j}{\sum^n_{j=0}m_j}
        \label{eq:jacobi}
    \end{aligned}
$$

We can reformulate the equations of motion in Jacobi coordinates, given in equation \ref{eq:jacobimotion}.

$$
    \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{n+1} = \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{n+1} - \frac{\sum^n_{j=0}m_j\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_j}{\sum^n_{j=0}m_j}
    \label{eq:jacobimotion}
$$

As we are investigating the case of an exterior perturbation, we only consider the equation for the innermost body, $$\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1$$, given in equation \ref{eq:perturb}.

<!--$$

    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:perturb}

The double summation terms can be collected, to give equation \ref{eq:perturbCollected},

<!--$$
    \begin{split}
        \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 &= Gm_0 \frac{\mathbf{R}_0 - \mathbf{R}_1}{|\mathbf{R}_0 - \mathbf{R}_1|^3} - Gm_1 \frac{\mathbf{R}_1 - \mathbf{R}_0}{|\mathbf{R}_1 - \mathbf{R}_0|^3} \\
        & + \sum_{j=2} \left[ Gm_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1|}^3} - G m_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0|}^3} \right]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:perturbCollected}
$$-->

For the Jacobian coordinates, We introduce the notation <!--$$|\mathbf{r}_i| \equiv r_i$-->. That is to say, coordinates in bold is the vector position, while non-bold is the magnitude of that vector. We also introduce the reduced mass, $$\mu$$, given as $$\mu_i = \nicefrac{m_i}{M}$$, where $$M$$ is the total mass of the system. As the central star typically dominates the mass of the system, this can also be written $$\mu_i \approx \nicefrac{m_i}{m_0}$.

<!--$$
    \begin{split}
        \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 &= -Gm_0 \frac{\mathbf{r}_1}{r_1^3} - Gm_1 \frac{\mathbf{r}_1}{r_1^3} \\
        & + \sum_{j=2} \left[ Gm_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1|}^3} - G m_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0|}^3} \right]
    \end{split}
$$-->

This can be further simplified to equation \ref{eq:keplerandperturb},

<!--$$
    \begin{split}
        \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 &= -G\left(m_0 + m_1\right)\frac{\mathbf{r}_1}{r_1^3} \\
        & + \sum_{j=2} \left[ Gm_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1|}^3} - Gm_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0|}^3} \right]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:keplerandperturb}
$$-->

In the 2-body case, where there is only a single body and star, this equation is the Keplerian equation of motion, as given in equation \ref{eq:kepler}. As the central star dominates the mass of the system, we can use $$m_0 + m_i \approx m_0$$ to simplify.

$$
    \begin{split}
        \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i &= -G\left(m_0+m_i\right)\frac{\mathbf{r}_i}{r_i^3} \\
        & \approx -Gm_0\frac{\mathbf{r}_i}{r_i^3}
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:kepler}
$$

From this, we can see that the acceleration in Jacobian coordinates for an n-body system as given by equation \ref{eq:keplerandperturb} is the standard Keplerian with some perturbative acceleration applied,

$$
    \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -G\left(m_0+m_1\right)\frac{\mathbf{r}_1}{r_1^3} + \delta\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1
$$

With the perturbing acceleration given in equation \ref{eq:perturbaccel},

<!--$$
    \delta\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 = \sum_{j=2} \left[ Gm_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1|}^3} - G m_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0|}^3} \right]
    \label{eq:perturbaccel}
$$-->

If we introduce terms to the first fractional part, we have equation \ref{eq:introducedterms}.

<!--$$
    \begin{split}
        \delta\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 &= \sum_{j=2} \left[ Gm_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1 + \mathbf{R}_0 - \mathbf{R}_0}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_1 + \mathbf{R}_0 - \mathbf{R}_0|}^3} - G m_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0|}^3} \right]\\
        &= \sum_{j=2} \left[ Gm_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0 - \mathbf{r}_1}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0 - \mathbf{r}_1|}^3} - G m_j \frac{\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0}{{| \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0|}^3} \right]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:introducedterms}
$$-->

We can consider the value of $$\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0$$ by using the general case in equation \ref{eq:jacobi}, to give the values for $$\mathbf{R}_j$,

$$
    \begin{split}
        \mathbf{r}_{n+1} &= \mathbf{R}_{n+1} - \frac{\sum^n_{j=0}m_j\mathbf{R}_j}{\sum^n_{j=0}m_j}\\
        \mathbf{R}_{n+1} &= \mathbf{r}_{n+1} + \frac{\sum^n_{j=0}m_j\mathbf{R}_j}{\sum^n_{j=0}m_j}
    \end{split}
$$

Which can be evaluated to give equation \ref{eq:rjr0}. Note the expression obtained in line 3, the value for $$\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0$$ is some combination of $$\mathbf{R}_k - \mathbf{R}_0$$ where $$0 < k < j$.

$$
    \begin{split}
        \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0 &= \mathbf{r}_j + \frac{\sum^{j-1}_{k=0}m_k\mathbf{R}_k}{\sum^{j-1}_{k=0}m_k} - \mathbf{R}_0\\
        &= \mathbf{r}_j + \frac{\sum^{j-1}_{k=1}m_k\mathbf{R}_k}{\sum^{j-1}_{k=0}m_k}\\
        &= \mathbf{r}_j + \sum^{j-1}_{k=1}{\mu_k\left(\mathbf{R}_k-\mathbf{R}_0\right)}\\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:rjr0}
$$

We define a new value $$\mathbf{r}_{j0}$$, as a shorthand for $$\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0$$, given in equation \ref{eq:rj0},

$$
    \mathbf{r}_{j0} \equiv \mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_0 = \mathbf{r}_j + \sum^{j-1}_{k=1}{\mu_k\left(\mathbf{R}_k-\mathbf{R}_0\right)}
    \label{eq:rj0}
$$

By combining equations \ref{eq:introducedterms} and \ref{eq:rjr0}, we obtain equation \ref{eq:jacobianmotion},

<!--$$
    \delta\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 = \sum_{j=2} \left[ Gm_j \frac{\mathbf{r}_{j0} - \mathbf{r}_1}{{| \mathbf{r}_{j0} - \mathbf{r}_1|}^3} - G m_j \frac{\mathbf{r}_{j0}}{r_{j,0}^3} \right]
    \label{eq:jacobianmotion}
$$-->

Which can be simplified slightly as equation \ref{eq:jacobianmotion2}, which gives the perturbing acceleration on the transiting planet. Additionally, this can be expanded in a Legendre series to first order, giving the second line in equation \ref{eq:jacobianmotion2}.

<!--$$
    \begin{split}
        \delta\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 &= \sum_{j=2} \left[ Gm_j\left( -\frac{\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_{j0}}{{| \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_{j0}|}^3} - \frac{\mathbf{r}_{j0}}{r_{j0}^3} \right)\right]\\
        &= \sum_{j=2} \left[ -\frac{Gm_j}{r_j^3}\left( \mathbf{r}_1 - 3\frac{\mathbf{r}_1\cdot\mathbf{r}_j}{r_j^2}\mathbf{r}_j \right) + \mathcal{O}\left(\nicefrac{r_1}{r_j}\right)^2\right]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:jacobianmotion2}
$$-->

To find the perturbed period of the transiting planet, we compute how this acceleration changes when averaged over the orbital period. The angular position of the transiting planet from the vantage point of earth, $$\theta_1$$, is given by the sum of its true anomaly, $$f_1$$, and argument of periapsis, $$\omega_1$. This is gives equation \ref{eq:angpos}. As the eccentricity of this planet is assumed zero, the true and mean anomaly are equal. We can also introduce the transit number, $$n_1$$, and epoch $$\tau_1$$, to this expression.

$$
    \begin{split}
        \theta_1 &= f_1 + \omega_1\\
                 &= n_1\left(t - \tau_1\right)\omega_1
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:angpos}
$$

Differentiating equation \ref{eq:angpos} with respect to time gives equation \ref{eq:difangpos}.

$$
    \dot{\theta}_1 = \dot{n}_1\left(t - \tau_1\right) + n_1 - n_1\dot{t}_{0,1}
    \label{eq:difangpos}
$$

Following \cite[section.~2.9]{murraybook}, we express $$\dot{n}$$ as a function of the semimajor axis: $$\dot{n}_1 = -\nicefrac{3n_1}{2a_1}\dot{a}_1$,

$$
    \begin{split}
        \dot{\theta}_1 &= \frac{3n_1\dot{a_1}}{2a_1}\left(t - \tau_1\right) + n_1 - n_1\dot{\tau}\\
        &= n_1 \left(\frac{3\dot{a}_1}{2a_1}\left(t - \tau_1\right) + 1 - \dot{\tau}\right)
    \end{split}
$$

Expressing the time derivatives $$\dot{a_1}$$, $$\dot{\tau}$$, and $$\dot{\omega}$$ in terms of $$\ddot{r}_1$$ gives equation \ref{eq:thetadot},

$$
    \dot{\theta}_1 = n_1\left(1 - \frac{2a_1^2}{G\left(m_0+m_1\right)}\sum_{j=2}\left[\frac{1}{2}\frac{Gm_ja_1}{r_j^3}\right]\right)
    \label{eq:thetadot}
$$

This demonstrates why the orbital period of the transiting planet increases, the addition of planets in the system causes an increase in the effective mass interior to its orbit by $$\frac{1}{2}m_j\left(\nicefrac{a_1}{r_j}\right)^3$.

We can finally obtain the timing of the (N+1)th transit, given in equation \ref{eq:perturbtransittime} \citep[see][Section~4]{agol2018}.

$$
    \begin{split}
        t - t_0 &= \int_{f_0}^{f_0 + 2\pi N}df_1\dot{\theta}_1^{-1}\\
        &= \int_{f_0}^{f_0 + 2\pi N}df_1n_1^{-1}\left[1+\frac{1}{m_0+m_1}\sum_{j=2}\left[m_j\left(\frac{a_1}{r_j}\right)^3\right]\right]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:perturbtransittime}
$$

Following <d-cite key="borkovits}, we can express the true anomaly of the transiting planet in terms of the true anomalies of the perturbing planets,

$$
    df_1 = \sum_{j=2} \left[\frac{P_j}{P_1} \frac{r_j^2}{a_j^2\left(1-e_j^2\right)^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}} df_j\right]
    \label{eq:trueanomfromother}
$$

As $$r$$ depends on $$f$$, we can introduce equation \ref{eq:orbitpos} (also given below as equation \ref{orbitpos2}) to equation \ref{eq:trueanomfromother}, giving equation \ref{eq:newtrueanom}.

$$
    r_i = \frac{a_i\left(1-e_i^2\right)}{1+e_i\cos{f_i}}
    \label{orbitpos2}
$$

$$
    \begin{split}
        df_1 &= \sum_{j=2} \left[\frac{P_j}{P_1} \frac{1}{a_j^2\left(1-e_j^2\right)^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}} \left(\frac{a_j\left(1-e_j^2\right)}{1+e_j\cos{f_j}}\right)^2 df_j \right] \\
        &= \sum_{j=2} \left[ \frac{P_j}{P_1} \frac{\left(1-e_j^2\right)^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}}{\left(1+e_j\cos{f_j}\right)^2} df_j\right]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:newtrueanom}
$$

As the original variable of integration in equation \ref{eq:perturbtransittime}, $$f_1$$, changes due to the perturbation, we rewrite the integral in terms of the unperturbed $$f_j$. As an approximation, we consider only the gravitational forces acting on the transiting planet, and treat the perturbing planets as following Keplerian orbits. The substitution for $$df_1$$ is given in equation \ref{eq:newtrueanom}, and gives equation \ref{eq:perturbtimenewvar}.

$$
    \begin{split}
        t-t_0 &= \sum_{j=2}\left[\int_{f_0}^{f_0 + 2\pi N}\right.&\left( df_jn_1^{-1}\frac{P_j}{P_1}\frac{\left(1-e_j^2\right)^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}}{\left(1+e_j\cos{f_j}\right)^2} \right.\\
        & & \left. \left. \cdot \left(1+\frac{m_j}{m_0+m_1}\left(\frac{a_1}{r_j}\right)^3\right)\right)\right]\\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:perturbtimenewvar}
$$

Which can be evaluated to give the timing of the (N+1)th transit, as shown in equation \ref{eq:finaltransittime}.

$$
    \begin{split}
        t - t_0 &= NP_1 + \frac{P_1^2}{2\pi\left(m_0+m_1\right)} \\
        &\cdot \sum_{j=2}\left[\frac{m_j \left(f_j+e_j\sin{f_j}\right)\left(1-e_j^2\right)^{\nicefrac{-3}{2}}}{P_j}\right]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:finaltransittime}
$$

To find the departure from linear ephemerides, and thus obtain the TTV, we subtract the mean transit time $$NP_1$$ from equation \ref{eq:finaltransittime}. As the $$f_j$$ terms also includes the mean motion, $$n\left(t-\tau_j\right)$$, of the perturbing planets, we subtract that too, giving equation \ref{eq:TTVperturb}. We have now found a model of TTV caused by the perturbation due to outer planets.

$$
    \begin{split}
        \delta{t_1} &= \frac{P_1^2}{2\pi\left(m_0+m_1\right)}\\
        &\cdot\sum_{j=2}\left[\frac{m_j\left(f_j - n_j\left(t-\tau_j\right)+e_j\sin{f_j}\right)\left(1-e_j^2\right)^{\nicefrac{-3}{2}}}{P_j}\right]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:TTVperturb}
$$

## Parameter search}

With a suite of analytical TTV models at our disposal, we need to determine methods for fitting to simulated or physical TTV signals, and determining the marginalization and uncertainty associated with the fit.

### Optimisation}

To determine this set of best fit parameters, we leverage the field of computational optimisation and the large quantity of implementations that have been written for it through the SciPy package <d-cite key="scipy}. There are various metrics and methods for optimisation, the most notable of which are discussed below.

#### Least squares regression}\label{lsq}

An appealing yet na√Øve approach to parameter determination, where the squared sum of the residuals to a fit is minimised. While this has benefits in the form of being expressible as linear algebra, and efficient implementation in many programming packages, it suffers on two accounts:

Least squares is a method of local minimisation, there is no way of determining if a solution is the global optimum without searching all possible solutions. Searching through all solutions is described by the brute-forcing algorithm, the complexity of which grows exponentially with the number of model parameters. This exponential growth leads to computationally expensive searches.

This method will also often under- or over-estimate the fitting parameters, as the residuals to the fit is not necessarily a good metric from initial parameters. This is most susceptible to random error in the data, and is less an issue on larger datasets.

#### Maximum likelihood}

Maximum likelihood estimation, or MLE, provides a numerical optimisation method for models that more accurately describe real world data, as opposed to the more idealised case within which linear regression was originally formulated. The logarithm of the likelihood function for Bayesian analysis is given in equation \ref{eq:likelihood}

<!--$$
    \label{eq:likelihood}
    \ln{p(y | x, \theta, M)} = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_n\left[\frac{\left(y_n - M(x, \theta)\right)^2}{s_n^2} + \ln{\left(2\pi s_n^2\right)}\right]
$$-->

Where $$x$$ and $$y$$ is the set of data, $$M$$ is the model to be fit, $$\theta$$ the parameters of the model, and $$s$$ is given by:

$$
    s_n^2 = \sigma_n^2 + f^2 \left[M(x, \theta)\right]^2
$$

Where the additional $$\sigma$$ is the error on each data point. The logarithm of the likelihood is used due to its concavity, and that a given log likelihood is the sum of individual log likelihoods, providing an intuitive base for usage.

#### Minimisation}

In computational parameter optimisation, it is standard to try to minimise, rather than maximise, the values of a function within a given parameter space. As we have highlighted the usefulness of maximum likelihood estimation, it is useful to quickly adapt this to the computational workflow. This is very easily achieved by simply attempting to minimise the \textit{negative} log likelihood of a model.

As mentioned in least squares regression, \ref{lsq}, it is preferable to find, or approximately find, the global optimal parameters, two methods for which are differential evolution <d-cite key="diffEvo} and dual annealing <d-cite key="dualAnnealing}. These global optimisation methods are accessed through the $$scipy.optimise$$ python package <d-cite key="scipy}.

\label{diffevo} Differential evolution takes inspiration from evolutionary science, and attempts to optimise a problem through iterative improvements to some metaheuristic, such as the log likelihood, of the solution. This is specifically achieved by initialising some large set of ``agents'', each with random starting parameters, and allowing them to converge to the global solution.

Dual annealing implements a different metaheuristic to differential evolution, taking its name from the controlled cooling of material (annealing) used in metallurgy. The method begins by considering the neighbouring parameters $$s^*$$ to its current solution $$s$$, and probabilistically deciding to move between those states. This probabilistic method is dependent upon the ``Temperature'' of each state, which is defined as some function of the likelihood of each state. The free energy of the system defines how much each parameter may vary, and is slowly reduced, eliminating solutions with lower likelihoods. This continues until the free energy is zero, and the system has found the optimum with maximum likelihood.

As a typical final step in global optimisation, we polish the found parameters with some local optimisation method. The specific tool used in this project is the bounded limited memory Broyden‚ÄìFletcher‚ÄìGoldfarb‚ÄìShanno algorithm <d-cite key="ByrdALM, ZhuAlgorithmL}, accessed through the $$scipy.optimise.minimize$$ method call. This method, like many other quasi-newton algorithms, iteratively converges to an optimal solution through gradient descent This is specifically achieved using the hessian matrix of the function, the square matrix of second-order partial derivatives with respect to the free parameters of the function.

### Model comparison}

In the case where models have an equivalent set of parameters, simply comparing the value of the maximum likelihood is sufficient to draw conclusions about their accuracy. If the number of parameters between models is inconsistent, this approach will naturally result in overfitting.

This is especially relevant for our transit models. For example, the initial TTV model seen in equation \ref{eq:ttvbarycentre} has two fixed parameters and an additional four free parameters per body in the system, while the extension to this, as seen in equation \ref{eq:TTVeccentric} has four fixed parameters and an additional five free parameters per body in the system. As the number of bodies in the system is an additional free parameter, some method of comparison is required.

#### Akaike information criterion}

To determine the quality for each model, some weighting dependent on their free parameters is introduced to the likelihood value <d-cite key="AIC, AIC2}.

$$
    \label{eq:aic}
    \text{AIC} = 2 k - 2 \ln{L}
$$

In the case where a model has $$k$$ free parameters, with a maximum likelihood $$L$$, the AIC value is as given in equation \ref{eq:aic}. This provides a middle ground between goodness of fit, and model simplicity, handling both under- and over-fitting simultaneously.

#### Corrected Akaike information criterion}

Where the sample size is small, the standard AIC method can lead to overfitting, and a correction is required to better describe the fit <d-cite key="AICC}. This extension to AIC attempts to fix the overfitting by introducing a further penalty from the number of data points, $$n$$, as seen in equation \ref{eq:aicc}.

$$
    \label{eq:aicc}
    \text{AICc} = AIC + \frac{2k^2 + 2k}{n-k-1} = \frac{2kn}{n-k-1} - 2 \ln{L}
$$

The exact form of the expression for the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) is not fixed, but is determined for the individual models to be scored. The equation given in \ref{eq:aicc} is the one used in this project, and is not representative of some general AICc expression. The commonality between all AICc expressions is the dependence on $$k^2$$, as all AICc are second-order estimates.

#### Bayesian information criterion}

Another model selection metric closely related to the corrected Akaike information criterion, BIC introduces a larger penalty for free parameters by weighting them with the number of observed data points <d-cite key="BIC}.

$$
    \label{eq:bic}
    \text{BIC} = k \ln{n} - 2 \ln{L}
$$

In the case where a model has $$k$$ free parameters, $$n$$ data points, and a maximum likelihood $$L$$, the BIC value is as given in equation \ref{eq:bic}. Models that have lower BIC values are generally preferred, though this does not always yield the optimal fit.

### Markov Chain, Monte Carlo}

To determine parameter bounds, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used through the $$Emcee$$ package <d-cite key="emcee}. This class of algorithms use the probability distribution of a function to construct a sample chain that converges to the desired distribution, typically one that is normally distributed around the true parameters. This begins very similarly to the differential evolution optimisation technique described in section \ref{diffevo}, where a set of ``walkers'' are initialised with arbitrary starting parameters, and allowed to walk around the parameter space according to some ensemble method.

The ensemble method used for this project is the stretch move <d-cite key="stretchMove}, a method that significantly outperforms the more traditional Metropolis-Hastings algorithm <d-cite key="MH-MCMC}. The position of a walker, $$X_k$$, is determined by randomly selecting another walker, $$X_j$$, and proposing a new position by interpolating between the two with some variable randomly drawn from the distribution, as given in equation \ref{eq:stretch}, \citep[see][eq.~7]{emcee}.

$$
    \label{eq:stretch}
    X_k(t) \xrightarrow{} Y = X_j + Z\left[X_k(t) - X_j\right]
$$

# Results / Discussion}

## Observations}\label{observations}

Six transit observations were planned at the beginning of this project to observe four different exoplanetary systems: HAT-P-13b, HAT-P-44b, and K2-19b. Of those, only two observations were made, both of HAT-P-13b, and are given in figures \ref{fig:hatp13b1} and \ref{fig:hatp13b2}. Significant cloud cover prevented further observations, and severely hampered the observation made on 2022-02-27 (figure \ref{fig:hatp13b2}).

\begin{figure}

Note the anomaly near the mid-transit time due to light cloud cover. Reported $$\nicefrac{R_p}{R_*}$$ is $$0.0844 \pm 0.0013$$ <d-cite key="hat-p-13b}.}
    \label{fig:hatp13b1}
\end{figure}

    \caption[De-trended transit curve for HAT-P-13b, observed 2022-02-27]{De-trended transit light curve for an observation of HAT-P-13b taken 2022-02-27 and analysed with HOPS <d-cite key="HOPS}. Note the large residuals and missing data in the second half of the transit, caused by clouds completely obscuring the star for several hours.}
    \label{fig:hatp13b2}
\end{figure}

The light-curves have been fit with HOPS <d-cite key="HOPS}, and have provided values for $$\nicefrac{R_p}{R_*}$$ close to the reported literature <d-cite key="hat-p-13b} when considering the large variance in flux caused by suboptimal weather conditions.

The observation on 2022-02-27, given in figure \ref{fig:hatp13b2}, shows large residuals and has had data points after the mid-transit time removed. This was due to large cloud cover that reduced sky visibility to $$0\%$$ for several hours during the middle of the transit. Re-introducing these data points to the HOPS fitting, the result in figure \ref{fig:hatp13b2error} is obtained. The relative change in flux due to the cloud cover is larger than the occlusion depth of the transit by a significant factor, causing hops to fit transit egress to this position.

    \label{fig:Wasp8tess}
\end{figure}

With *TESS* light curves collected from the Mikulski archive for space telescopes, additional mid-transit times could be computed to complement those collected from the exoplanet transit database and ExoClock database, as was briefly touched upon in section \ref{objectives}.

### De-trending}

Many of the *TESS* light curves show strong long-term trends that can make transit detection difficult. To de-trend the data, a Gaussian process is fit to the out-of transit data, using the linear ephemerides for the planetary system to deduce the locations of transits. This was performed using an approximate Matern kernel using the Juliet wrapper <d-cite key="juliet} to the Celerite package <d-cite key="celerite}. This gives the black line seen in figures \ref{fig:hats46tess}, and \ref{fig:Wasp8tess}, which very closely matches the overall light curve trend.

### Transit fitting}

Transit fits were then performed on the de-trended data, using the Juliet wrapper to both the Batman <d-cite key="batman} and Dynesty <d-cite key="dynesty} packages. The parameters for the transit models are initialised by randomly selecting from the priors, and iteratively walked through parameter space. The general parameters for the exoplanet are returned to the posteriors of the fit, which adequately match the confirmed literature despite having few transits and no initial parameters to work from.

Taking the posteriors found for HATS-46b, as compared to the detection paper <d-cite key="hats46b}, we have the results as given in table \ref{tab:hats46b}

\begin{table}

	\label{tab:hats46b}
\end{table}

### TTV Residuals}

By subtracting the found transit times from computed ephemerides, TTV residuals are computed for each transit. The transit uncertainty is read directly from the Juliet posteriors, and can be seen in the bottom half of figures \ref{fig:hats46tess}, and \ref{fig:Wasp8tess}.

The uncertainty in the residuals are proportional to the depth of the transit divided by the variance in the data, as seen in the two provided figures. From this, we would expect the magnitude and standard deviation of TTV to be approximately the same order of magnitude. Of particular note in that regard are the Wasp-8 TTV residuals: all of them lie more than one sigma from the centre of the O-C diagram.

## Simulation pipeline}

### Initialisation}
The simulation pipeline makes use of the REBOUND <d-cite key="rebound} and REBOUNDx <d-cite key="reboundx} packages for numerical integration. The pipeline has been created to accept either a given planetary system, as seen in figure \ref{fig:trappistlayout}, or a $$.csv$$ file holding orbital elements.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Images/TRAPPIST-1_layout}
    \caption[TRAPPIST-1 System Layout]{system layout as generated by the simulation pipeline for TRAPPIST-1.}
    \label{fig:trappistlayout}
\end{figure}

The system is set up from provided parameters, and iterated forward using IAS15 <d-cite key="reboundias15}. Transits are evaluated where the position of the star, $$\hat{R_*}$$, and position of the target, $$\hat{R_T}$$, satisfy the following,

$$
    \hat{R}_*.y < \hat{R}_T.y
$$\vspace{-0.75cm}
$$
    \hat{R}_*.x \approx \hat{R}_T.x
$$

### Simulated TTV}
The transit time is found by iteratively decreasing simulation step time, and integrating until the desired precision is met, which is 1 millisecond by default. This provides a set of simulated transit times which are fit to TTV using least squares regression as mentioned in section \ref{lsq}. In the case of TRAPPIST-1b, the simulation output is as seen in figure \ref{fig:trappistTTV}.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Images/TTVSimulation_trappist-1b}
    \caption[TRAPPIST-1b simulated TTV]{TTV Residuals for TRAPPIST-1b according to simulation. Note the complex sinusoidal motion and large magnitudes due to the highly-resonant nature of the system. Additionally, note the thickness of the TTV curve, caused by low period variations due to non-resonant interactions. }
    \label{fig:trappistTTV}
\end{figure}

The simulation pipeline integrates the effect of General Relativity, but could be further extended to include effects such as tidal deformation, stellar evolution, to even those as subtle as the Yarkovsky effect.

## Analytical Models}

Following the derivations in section \ref{ttvmodels}, analytical models were converted to vectorisable code to be executed by the computation pipeline. The translation from equation to code is mostly intuitive, and can be seen in this project's GitHub repo,  \hyperlink{https://github.com/SK1Y101/TransitProject}{https://github.com/SK1Y101/TransitProject}.

### System and TTV}

To demonstrate the capabilities of the model, we selected exoplanetary systems with known TTV signals and generated synthetic systems whose properties were representative of the real systems, to allow precise control of TTV magnitude during testing phases. An example system layout is given in figure \ref{fig:examplelayout}.

Running the TTV simulation over a timescale of 200 years gives the residuals seen in figure \ref{fig:exampleTTVSim}. A 200-year integration is not representative of any known transiting planet, the earliest transiting data dates to 1999 <d-cite key="firstTransit}, and was simply chosen to better demonstrate the long-term evolution of the transit timing variation. The variance of data returned by the simulation is the standard deviation of measured TTV. For real systems, however, this variance is computed from the uncertainties of known parameters.

The initial parameters used in this synthetic system are given in table \ref{tab:systemparams}.

\end{table}

### Model comparison}

To determine the validity of the analytical models, they were executed with the initial parameters used to set up the system. As the transiting planet is the outermost in the system, the first class of TTV models \ref{classone} is used to analytically approximate the system. The models as derived in this paper are given in equations \ref{eq:ttvbarycentre}, \ref{eq:partialeccentricity}, and \ref{eq:TTVeccentric}, which are re-summarised below,

$$
    \delta_T = -\frac{P_T}{2 \pi a_T}\sum_i^n \left[ a_i \mu_i \sin \frac{2 \pi \left(t - t_{0,i} \right)}{P_i}\right]
$$

$$
    \delta_T = -\frac{P_T}{2 \pi a_T}\sum_i^n \left[ a_i \mu_i \frac{1 - e_i^2}{1 + e_i \cos f_i} \sin \left(f_i + \omega_i\right) \right]
$$

$$
    \begin{split}
        \delta_T &= -\frac{P_T}{2 \pi a_T}\left(\frac{1 - e_T^2}{1 + 2 e_T \cos f_T + e_T^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}\\
        & \cdot\sum_i^n \left[ a_i \mu_i \frac{1 - e_i^2}{1 + e_i \cos f_i} \sin \left(f_i + \omega_i\right) \right]
    \end{split}
$$

The TTV curves generated by these models are shown in figure \ref{fig:testmodelcomparisonold}. Despite the various approximations used in the derivation for each model, and the subsequent applicability space for which they are valid, they match the simulated TTV to within the 1-sigma bounds.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Images/TTVTestModelComparisonold}
    \caption[Analytical TTV given synthetic system initial parameters]{Analytical TTV curves for the synthetic system, using the initial parameters. Model1, Model2, and Model3 are the models described in equations \ref{eq:ttvbarycentre}, \ref{eq:partialeccentricity}, and \ref{eq:TTVeccentric} respectively. Each graph shows a 5 transit snippet from the TTV curve. Simulated TTV times are overlaid in black.}
    \label{fig:testmodelcomparisonold}
\end{figure}

Additionally, note how the overall shape of the analytical curves change as a result of first introducing perturbed eccentricity, and then transiting planet eccentricity. Strictly speaking, the sections of the analytical curves between each transit do not correspond to anything physically within the system. They describe the predicted TTV, were the transiting planet to have a slightly offset time of periapsis passage.

### Parameter optimisation}
As we have now demonstrated the accuracy of the models, to some set of initial parameters, the next stage is in the reverse: finding some parameters for which the model fits the data set.

To do this, the three models were each initialised with the fixed parameters, those being the properties of the host star and transiting planet, and three sets of arbitrary initial parameters corresponding to a system with one, two, and three planets additional to the transiting target, giving an effective set of 9 models to optimise. Each of these were optimised with both dual annealing <d-cite key="dualAnnealing} and differential evolution <d-cite key="diffEvo}, for which the best fit of the two methods was selected as that model's maximum likelihood solution.

The optimal TTV curves found for each model are given in figure \ref{fig:modelcurves}, where the table of the optimal solution values for each model is given in tables \ref{tab:1planetcorrectedfittingparameters}, \ref{tab:2planetcorrectedfittingparameters}, and \ref{tab:3planetcorrectedfittingparameters}.

### Model selection}

How a model is selected as most likely is two-fold. To begin with, we sample the solutions for each model to determine marginalisation and uncertainties. The parameter space is sampled using MCMC <d-cite key="emcee}, and a normal parameter distribution constructed from the sampler. This is then converted to a set of quantiles, specifically $$16\%$$, $$50\%$$, and $$84\%$$, representing the reportable parameters and one sigma variance. The entire normal distribution is reported in a corner plot using the corner package <d-cite key="corner}.

With the set of best fit parameters and error bounds for each model, the accuracy of their fit is determined by scoring with the three information criterion discussed earlier: AIC <d-cite key="AIC, AIC2}, AICc <d-cite key="AICC}, and BIC <d-cite key="BIC}. The information criterion values for each model for this data is given in table \ref{tab:informationCriterion}

## Discussion}

### Evaluation}

We have successfully demonstrated the accuracy of analytical transit timing variation models as compared to TTV signals, seen in figure \ref{fig:testmodelcomparisonold}, as well as the potential for this methodology to be applied to determining the parameters of TTV systems, seen in figure \ref{fig:modelsystemlayout}. We have also demonstrated the capabilities of our computational pipeline, and the possibilities for further work that could be implemented using it.

Therefore, although it has not yet been demonstrated for a known exoplanetary system, the method and computational pipeline outlined in this paper should be capable of producing similar results when using real transit timing variation data. Further study in this field would allow this to be proven, and further refinements should reduce the computational time required to perform each analysis.

### Limitations}\label{limitations}

One of the primary goals was the observation of exoplanetary transits, with six observation windows planned at the beginning of the project. One of those observations was severely hampered by cloud cover, and four others had to be cancelled.

While part of this project focused on finding the globally optimal solution, this does not necessarily always exist. Due to the highly chaotic nature of gravitational interactions, multiple systems layouts can provide identical or near identical TTV signals. This is best demonstrated in the detection paper for kepler-19c, \citep[see][fig.~14]{Keplerc}, where a single TTV signal had no fewer than eight possible configurations for the orbit of an extra planet.

This demonstrates a possible drawback of this method, and would require additional constraints based on complementary observations for any tentative detections made using transit timing variations to be considered.

The best-fit for the synthetic system, given in table \ref{tab:bestfitparams}, gave only a single perturbing planet as the maximum likelihood, as opposed to the two that were used to initialise the simulation. This is due to the outer perturbing planet dominating the TTV signal, as seen in figure \ref{fig:exampleTTVSim}, due to its larger semi-major axis. This demonstrates the second drawback of this methodology, and ties into the statement about non-unique TTV solutions: the additional effect on TTV due to more than one perturber can become negligible.

This could be circumvented by fitting for a TTV cause to find the most dominant planetary effect, and then subtracting that from the known TTV signal. This would leave only the effects of other planets in the system, which could be fed back into the fitting pipeline to determine the parameters of the second perturber, and so on. This would, however, require a longer integration time for the computational pipeline.

As an additional point, we see the second-best fit given in table \ref{tab:bestfitparams} \textit{does} pick out the second planetary signal. The higher Akaike information criterion for this model is almost singularly decided by the model having 9 free parameters, as opposed to 4. Further research may benefit from re-evaluating the information criterion used. A disparity in our implementation may come from the assumptions made when determining the number of free parameters for each model: The original AIC assumed each free parameter contributed an additional polynomial power, while our paper assumed each orbital element contributed an additional free parameter.

### Errors}

A sample output was generated while writing this paper to show some problems associated with the TTV fitting pipeline during its development. For this broken state, Figure \ref{fig:testmodelfittingcomparisonold} shows the best-fit TTV curves generated by model 1, and tables \ref{tab:1planetfittingparameters}, \ref{tab:2planetfittingparameters}, and \ref{tab:3planetfittingparameters}, show the output parameters found.

    \label{fig:testmodelfittingcomparisonold}
\end{figure}

We can see that some magnitudes predicted are on the order of $$10^9$$ seconds, and some did not generate a TTV at all.
This is clearly incorrect, and there are a few reasons as to why.

First, while the distances and times in the initial data \textit{should} have been in astronomical units and years when loaded, the simulation pipeline used metres and days. A smaller issue was seen in the parameter optimisation output, where many values for $$\mu$$ are zero and many values for $$e$$ are close to 1. To align the planets with values seen in real exoplanets, we modified the eccentricity selection to prefer lower values and defined a lower bound on $$\mu$$ at $$10^{-9}$. As a reference, the lowest planet to star mass ratio of any discovered planet is PSR B1257+12 b at $$4.092*10^{-9}$.

Additionally, many of the `best fit` solutions gave planets whose orbits are near identical. This solution, while technically satisfying the minimisation criterion, does not aptly describe physical planetary systems, and so an additional factor must be introduced when determining maximum likelihood.

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        r_{H, min} = a \left(1-e\right) \sqrt[3]{\frac{m}{3M}} \\
        r_{H, max} = a \left(1+e\right) \sqrt[3]{\frac{m}{3M}}
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:hillsphere}
$$

The Hill sphere of a celestial body is the region over which it dominates the attraction of satellites, as compared to its orbital parent. The radii of the hill sphere are given in equation \ref{eq:hillsphere}, where $$M$$ is the mass of the primary body, and $$m$$, $$a$$, and $$e$$ are the mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity of the secondary body respectively. As the extent of the hill sphere is dependent upon the distance between the body and it's parent, we require two expressions for the maximum and minimum radii. We can use this to define the boundaries of a region of instability that other planets in the system cannot cross, given in equation \ref{eq:boundary}, \citep[see][eq.~7]{boundaryStability}, where $$n$$ is some additional term that increases the effective size of the hill sphere, as orbital perturbations in the immediate vicinity can cause bodies initially outside the boundary region to intersect with it. While this is not a strict requirement for long-term stability, as the orbits of Pluto and Neptune show, we will not consider those exoplanets with intersecting orbits.

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        Boundary_{inner} = a \left(1-e\right)\left[1 - n\sqrt[3]{\frac{m}{3M}}\right] \\
        Boundary_{outer} = a \left(1+e\right)\left[1 + n\sqrt[3]{\frac{m}{3M}}\right]
    \end{aligned}

# Conclusion}

The aim of this project was to increase historical transit data by observing exoplanet transits, to develop a set of analytical TTV models to approximate transit timing variation, and to create a computational pipeline for TTV analysis that should be capable of determining the best fit parameters for those models. On all three accounts, this project has been successful, with observations logged to the ExoClock database to be included in their updated ephemerides paper later this year, the models as derived in the methodology section of this paper, and a well documented codebase available in this project's GitHub repository. As mentioned in sections \ref{observations} and \ref{limitations}, only 2 transits could be observed, less than originally intended.

We have demonstrated that the analytical models are a valid descriptor for TTV signals, provided they are used within the bounds of their approximation, and that the computational pipeline is adequate for fitting those models to data. As the main programming objectives have been met, further development with the computational pipeline would focus on code optimisation and refactoring.

Although real TTV data was used to test the computational pipeline and models, no analysis was performed on them due to time constraints, especially the length of time required to fit light curves to *TESS* data when using the Gaussian process. Further research would build on this project and perform analysis of real planetary systems, as we have demonstrated the methodology to be sound.

## Transit duration derivation}\label{transitderiv}

As demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:transitLoc}, a transit begins the moment the planetary disk overlaps the stellar disk, reaches maximum occlusion when the centres of the star and planet are aligned, and ends once the planetary disk no longer overlaps the stellar disk. The centre-to-centre distance between the exoplanet and star at transit ingress and egress is thus the sum of their angular radii,

$$
    s_{ingress} = s_{egress} = R_{star} + R_{planet}
$$

As a transit occurs between ingress and egress, the total angular distance the exoplanet must cover is simply twice this,

$$
    s_{transit} = 2 R_{star} + 2 R_{planet}
$$

If we assume the exoplanets orbit is large compared to the distance travelled during a transit, this linear distance will approximately equal the distance travelled by the exoplanet during the transit. If we additionally assume the orbit of the exoplanet is circular, then the tangential velocity will remain constant,

$$
    v = \text{const.} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{G(m_{star}+m_{planet})}{a}}
$$

The total duration of the transit in this case is given from the standard equations of motion,

$$
    T_{transit} = \frac{s}{v} = \frac{2 R_{star} + 2 R_{planet}}{v_{planet}}
$$

Which is the expression for transit duration given in equation \ref{eq:transitduration}.

As a useful stepping stone, we instead consider the transit distance as that of a circle arc. The radius of this circle is the semi-major axis, $$a$$, and the angle swept by the transit, $$\beta$$, in radians. Thus, the transit time is given,

$$
    T_{transit} = \frac{a \beta}{v}
$$

The swept angle, $$\beta$$, is also the angle swept by an isosceles triangle of base $$2 R_{star} + 2 R_{planet}$$ and sides $$a$$, as demonstrated by observing the transit from above. The angle, $$\beta$$, can therefore be given by the law of cosines,

$$
    c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos{\gamma}
$$

Which, if written using our orbital parameters, becomes

$$
    \left(2 R_{star} + 2 R_{planet}\right)^2 = 2a^2(1 - \cos{\beta})
    \label{eq:start}
$$

Rearranging gives,

$$
    1 - \cos{\beta} = \frac{\left(2 R_{star} + 2 R_{planet}\right)^2}{2a^2}
$$

This can be reformulated from trigonometric identity, $$1-\cos{x} = 2\sin^2 x/2$,

$$
    2\sin^2\frac{\beta}{2} = \frac{\left(2 R_{star} + 2 R_{planet}\right)^2}{2a^2}
$$

Which simplifies as,

$$
    \sin\frac{\beta}{2} = \frac{R_{star} + R_{planet}}{2a}
$$

obtaining the expression for $$\beta$,

$$
    \beta = 2\arcsin{\frac{R_{star} + R_{planet}}{a}}
    \label{eq:end}
$$

Which gives the transit duration,

$$
    T_{transit} = \frac{2 a}{v}\arcsin{\frac{R_{star} + R_{planet}}{a}}
$$

This of course exactly matches the expression given in equation \ref{eq:transitduration2}. As any given exoplanet may not transit exactly aligned with the equator of the stellar disk due to its relative inclination, the distance covered during a transit must also account for this.

There are two orbital elements that describe the orientation of a circular orbit, the inclination, $$i$$, and longitude of the ascending node, $$\Omega$. As we do not have a defined ``zero angle'' for an arbitrary exoplanet, these will be described as their relative inclination, defined as zero when the planet transits the stellar equator, and relative longitude of the ascending node, defined as zero when perpendicular to our line of sight.

The offset from the stellar equator from our point of view is thus,

$$
    b = a \cos i \sin \Omega
$$

The transverse distance of the transit is then described by a right-angled triangle of hypotenuse $$$ R_{star} + R_{planet}$$ and height $$b$$, which can be recovered from Pythagorean theorem,

$$
    s_{transverse}^2 + b^2 = \left( R_{star} + R_{planet} \right)^2
$$

which gives the transverse distance as,

$$
    s_{transverse} = \frac{s_{transit}}{2} = \sqrt{\left( R_{star} + R_{planet} \right)^2 - b^2}
$$

following the same derivation between equations \ref{eq:start} and \ref{eq:end} gives the modified swept angle of the transit as,

$$
    \beta_b = 2\arcsin{\frac{\sqrt{\left( R_{star} + R_{planet} \right)^2 - b^2}}{a}}
$$

Which gives a transit duration of,

$$
    T_{transit} = \frac{2 a}{v}\arcsin{\frac{\sqrt{\left( R_{star} + R_{planet} \right)^2 - b^2}}{a}}
$$

which is of course our expression given in equation \ref{eq:transitduration3}.
