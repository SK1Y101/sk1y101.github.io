	abstract   = {We present new near-infrared spectroscopic measurements of the Hβ region for a sample of 29 luminous high-redshift quasars. We have measured the width of Hβ in those sources and added archival Hβ width measurements to create a sample of 92 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for which Hβ width and rest-frame UV measurements of N V λ1240 and C IV λ1549 emission lines are available. Our sample spans 6 orders of magnitude in luminosity and includes 31 radio-loud AGNs. It also includes 10 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and one broad absorption line quasar. We find that metallicity, indicated by the N V/C IV line ratio, is primarily correlated with accretion rate, which is a function of luminosity and Hβ line width. This may imply an intimate relation between starbursts, responsible for the metal enrichment of the nuclear gas, and AGN fueling, represented by the accretion rate. The correlation of metallicity with luminosity, or black hole (BH) mass, is weaker in contrast to recent results that were based on measurements of the width of C IV. We argue that using C IV as a proxy to Hβ in estimating MBH might be problematic and lead to spurious BH mass and accretion rate estimates in individual sources. We discuss the potential implications of our new result in the framework of the starburst-AGN connection and theories of BH growth.}

	abstract   = {Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have been quite massive (~100-300 M☉). If they retain their high mass until death, such stars will, after about 3 Myr, make pair-instability supernovae. Models for these explosions have been discussed in the literature for four decades, but very few included the effects of rotation and none employed a realistic model for neutrino trapping and transport. Both turn out to be very important, especially for those stars whose cores collapse into black holes (helium cores above about 133 M☉). We consider the complete evolution of two zero-metallicity stars of 250 and 300 M☉. Despite their large masses, we argue that the low metallicities of these stars imply negligible mass loss. Evolving the stars with no mass loss, but including angular momentum transport and rotationally induced mixing, the two stars produce helium cores of 130 and 180 M☉. Products of central helium burning (e.g., primary nitrogen) are mixed into the hydrogen envelope with dramatic effects on the radius, especially in the case of the 300 M☉ model. Explosive oxygen and silicon burning cause the 130 M☉ helium core (250 M☉ star) to explode, but explosive burning is unable to drive an explosion in the 180 M☉ helium core, and it collapses to a black hole. For this star, the calculated angular momentum in the presupernova model is sufficient to delay black hole formation, and the star initially forms an ~50 M☉, 1000 km core within which neutrinos are trapped. The calculated growth time for secular rotational instabilities in this core is shorter than the black hole formation time, and they may develop. If so, the estimated gravitational wave energy and wave amplitude are EGW ≈ 10-3 M☉ c2 and h+ ≈ 10-21/d(Gpc), but these estimates are very rough and depend sensitively on the nonlinear nature of the instabilities. After the black hole forms, accretion continues through a disk. The mass of the disk depends on the adopted viscosity but may be quite large, up to 30 M☉ when the black hole mass is 140 M☉. The accretion rate through the disk can be as large as 1-10 M☉ s-1. Although the disk is far too large and cool to transport energy efficiently to the rotational axis by neutrino annihilation, it has ample potential energy to produce a 1054 erg jet driven by magnetic fields. The interaction of this jet with surrounding circumstellar gas may produce an energetic gamma-ray transient, but given the probable redshift and the consequent timescale and spectrum, this model may have difficulty explaining typical gamma-ray bursts.}

    abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) reside in the centre of most local galaxies, but they also power active galactic nuclei and quasars, detected up to z = 7. These quasars put constraints on early BH growth and the mass of BH seeds. The scenario of ‘direct collapse’ is appealing as it leads to the formation of large mass BH seeds, 104–106 M⊙, which eases explaining how quasars at z = 6–7 are powered by BHs with masses \\&gt;109 M⊙. Direct collapse, however, appears to be rare, as the conditions required by the scenario are that gas is metal-free, the presence of a strong photodissociating Lyman–Werner flux, and large inflows of gas at the centre of the halo, sustained for 10–100 Myr. We performed several cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that cover a large range of box sizes and resolutions, thus allowing us to understand the impact of several physical processes on the distribution of direct collapse BHs. We identify haloes where direct collapse can happen, and derive the number density of BHs. We also investigate the discrepancies between hydrodynamical simulations, direct or post-processed, and semi-analytical studies. Under optimistic assumptions, we find that for direct collapse to account for BHs in normal galaxies, the critical Lyman–Werner flux required for direct collapse must be about two orders of magnitude lower than predicted by 3D simulations that include detailed chemical models. However, when supernova feedback is relatively weak, enough direct collapse BHs to explain z = 6–7 quasars can be obtained for Lyman–Werner fluxes about one order of magnitude lower than found in 3D simulations.},
