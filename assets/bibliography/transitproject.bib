 abstract = {Based on the Tsallis statistics, the generalized simulated annealing algorithm (GSA) is tested and developed. Studies on the Thomson model show that the GSA is more efficient than the classical simulated annealing and the fast simulated annealing. The fluctuation of energy is reduced drastically. The convergence to the global minimum is fast. We believe the GSA algorithm is a powerful method to find the global minimum in more realistic problems, like the equilibrium structure of big clusters.}

It is based on the gradient projection method and uses a limited memory BFGS matrix to approximate the Hessian of the objective function. It is shown how to take advantage of the form of the limited memory approximation to implement the algorithm efficiently. The results of numerical tests on a set of large problems are reported.}
