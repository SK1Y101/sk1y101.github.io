  title={Distinguishing Intermediate Mass Black Hole Mergers From Short Duration Glitches},
  author={Lloyd-Walters, Jack},
  abstract={Glitches are a frequent occurrence with LIGO data, on the order of 10 an hour, and represent unwanted noise when searching for gravitational wave signals. Due to their similarity to IMBH merger events, they represent an obstacle to any search that deals with higher mass black holes. With a viable model of these glitch events, a full search could more easily distinguish IMBH mergers from short duration glitches. The glitch model created for this report was found to be accurate when searching against LIGO data using traditional matched filtering, and showed high similarity to events identified using the omicron scan, despite the difference in methods for detection. This glitch model was shown to not hinder a search for IMBH’s, as merger templates for GW190521 still responded more strongly than the glitch model, showing it’s safety in respect to true mergers. As such, this could pose a viable model for an extended search across a much larger swathe of LIGO data, with higher mass resolutions providing a logical improvement.},
