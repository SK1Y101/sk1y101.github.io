  author     = {Lloyd-Walters, Jack},
  abstract   = {Glitches are a frequent occurrence with LIGO data, on the order of 10 an hour, and represent unwanted noise when searching for gravitational wave signals. Due to their similarity to IMBH merger events, they represent an obstacle to any search that deals with higher mass black holes. With a viable model of these glitch events, a full search could more easily distinguish IMBH mergers from short duration glitches. The glitch model created for this report was found to be accurate when searching against LIGO data using traditional matched filtering, and showed high similarity to events identified using the omicron scan, despite the difference in methods for detection. This glitch model was shown to not hinder a search for IMBH’s, as merger templates for GW190521 still responded more strongly than the glitch model, showing it’s safety in respect to true mergers. As such, this could pose a viable model for an extended search across a much larger swathe of LIGO data, with higher mass resolutions providing a logical improvement.},

  title      = {Is There A Possibility Of Extrasolar Habitation},
  author     = {Lloyd-Walters, Jack},
  abstract   = {This study focuses on the possibility of M-Dwarf stellar systems being suitable locations for the development and evolution of life from an astrophysical standpoint, from simple chemical processes to complex cellular organisms, looking in particular at the exoplanets within the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system at possible habitable candidates: e, f, and g. It also looks at the possibility that the supposed life has had adequate time and conditions necessary to facilitate the emergence of Extra-terrestrial intelligence, an extent to which may be detectable from earth-based sources, such as accidental and deliberate radio transmissions or observable artificial changes of the planetary atmospheres.},
