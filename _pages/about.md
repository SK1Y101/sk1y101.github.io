I'm [Jack Lloyd-Walters](https://lloydwaltersj.com/), I'm one of those "programmer people" everyone likes to ask for printer advice. Sometimes I write code that does stuff, most of the time that code is purely for my own entertainment.

### About me

Iâ€™m a software engineer I for the [Metal as a Service](https://maas.io/) team at Canonical. Prior to that, I studied Physics, Astronomy, and Cosmology and the University of Portsmouth where I graduated with First class Masters.

I love writing code with Python, and I reckon I've become fairly competent with it in the many years since 2011.

My primary interests are definitely spaceflight, astronomy, and programming.
<sub>I wonder how many of those were obvious</sub>

Welcome to my [personal website](https://lloydwaltersj.com/), I'll steadily be adding anything of relevance here, collating all of my projects and occasionally dropping news and blog posts.

  <sup>
    Do not attach a lot of weight to occasionally, I am... sporadic... with regular posts. Just look at my github commit history per repo.
