Hi there, I'm Jack!

I'm a Final year masters student in astrophysics at Portsmouth university with a strong passion for Python programming, exoplanetary science, and gravitational wave astronomy. I'm currently looking to begin a career in computational physics, focusing primarily on astronomical research or spacecraft operations.

The remainder of this Bio is a Work In Progress.

### Support me

A lot of my work, especially if it's personal, is free, open source, and probably always will be. If you want to go above and beyond and support that, I do accept cups of tea.
