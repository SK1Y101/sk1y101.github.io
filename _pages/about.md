Hi there, I'm Jack!

I'm a Final year masters student in astrophysics at Portsmouth university with a strong passion for Python programming, exoplanetary science, and gravitational wave astronomy. I'm currently looking to begin a career in computational physics, focusing primarily on astronomical research or spacecraft operations.

### Projects

A small selection of projects I'm proud of

for an extended list of things I'm working on, or have previously worked with, see <a href="sk1y101.github.io/projects">the projects section</a> of this website.

### Support me

A lot of my work, especially if it's personal, is free, open source, and probably always will be. If you want to go above and beyond and support that, I do accept cups of tea.
